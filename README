vegas
-----
This package is for evaluating multidimensional integrals using
an improved version of the adaptive Monte Carlo vegas algorithm.
The central package is :mod:`vegas`. A tutorial on its use
is in doc/html/index.html (or doc/vegas.pdf if you prefer pdf).

The vegas algorithm has been widely used for decades. It can be
used on modern laptops to do integrals using 100s of millions
of integrand evaluations.

Test :mod:`vegas` using 'make tests.' Some simple examples are
in the examples directory.

Installation instructions are in the INSTALLATION file.
